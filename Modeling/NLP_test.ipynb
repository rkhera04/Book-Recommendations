The current study aims to increase the efficiency of license plate recognition system for Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP) smart university. This venture comprises of simulation program to recognize license plate characters where a captured image of vehicles will be the input. Then, these images will be processed using several image processing techniques and optical character recognition method in order to recognize the segmented number plate. The image processing techniques consist of colour conversion, image segmentation using Otsu's thresholding, noise removal, image subtraction, image cropping and bounding box feature. The optical character recognition based on template matching approach is used to analyse the printed characters on the segmented license plate image and to produce an output data consisting of characters.
